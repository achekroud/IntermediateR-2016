There are three scripts that we will work through in order

01 -- First, we review the basics of R programming: objects, indexing, loops, & functions

02 -- Next, we review some "best practices" & stylistic guidelines for R programmming

03 -- Third, we run through a quick ggplot introduction, courtesy of Edwin Chen

04 -- Finally, we tie it together in an example: visualising a large public dataset in R.
